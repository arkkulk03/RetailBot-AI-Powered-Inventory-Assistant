# RetailBot: AI-Powered Inventory Assistant
## 🚀 Project Overview
RetailBot transforms how retail managers interact with their databases by enabling natural language conversations with inventory systems. This intelligent assistant bridges the gap between human language and SQL queries, making data access effortless for non-technical users.
The Challenge: Store managers at AtliQ Tees needed quick access to inventory insights but lacked SQL expertise to query their database effectively.
The Solution: An AI-powered chatbot that understands natural language questions and instantly converts them into precise SQL queries, delivering real-time inventory insights.
## 🎯 Key Features
